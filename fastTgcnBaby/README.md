I currently have my folder set up as specified in the readme of the MIVRC/Fast-TGCN repository: https://github.com/MIVRC/Fast-TGCN
They say:
"To train the Fast-TGCN, please put the trainning data and testing data into data/train and data/test, respectively. Then, you can start to train a Fast-TGCN model by following command: python train.py"
